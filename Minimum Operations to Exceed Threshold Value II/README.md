# Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II - Java Solution

## Description

This Java program finds the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in an array greater than or equal to a given threshold `k`. The program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to iteratively combine the smallest elements according to a defined formula.

## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you will:
- Take the two smallest integers `x` and `y` in `nums`.
- Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.
- Add `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` anywhere in the array.

You can only apply the operation if `nums` contains at least two elements.

Return the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to `k`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Usage

1. Create an instance of the `Solution` class.
2. Call the `minOperations` method with an integer array and threshold `k` as input.
3. The method will return the minimum number of operations needed.

## Example

```java
Solution sol = new Solution();
int[] nums = {2, 11, 10, 1, 3};
int result = sol.minOperations(nums, 10);
System.out.println(result); // Output: 2
```

## Explanation

- The smallest numbers are taken and transformed using the given formula.
- This process repeats until all elements in the array are `>= k`.
- A priority queue ensures we always work with the smallest elements first.

## Key Fixes and Optimizations

1. **Handling a Single Element in the Heap:**
   - Initially, the code did not check if the heap contained only one element before accessing it. This could cause an error when calling `peek()`.
   - Solution: Added a condition `while (minHeap.size() > 1 && minHeap.peek() < k)` to prevent errors.

2. **Preventing Integer Overflow:**
   - The computation `min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y)` could exceed the `int` limit, leading to negative values.
   - Solution: Changed the variable type from `int` to `long` to prevent overflow.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N log N)`, as we perform `N` insertions and deletions in the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`, as we store all elements in the heap.
